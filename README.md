# Claude's Viral Growth Machine

**HackNU 2026 | Growth Engineering Track**

Reverse-engineering how Claude became one of the most talked-about AI products on the internet. Built scrapers to collect public discourse, a 4-step processing pipeline to enrich the data, and an automated monitoring system a growth team could use every Monday morning.

## Key Findings

Our analysis of 4,346 data points (3,353 Reddit posts + 993 YouTube videos) revealed 8 growth patterns:

1. **Pentagon > product launches** — 72 posts, 246K upvotes, 0.23 keyword correlation. Claude hit #1 on App Store from a political stance, not a feature release.
2. **Reactive beats educational 2.7x** — reactive content (1,681 avg engagement) vs educational (612). The content companies invest most in drives the least growth.
3. **r/technology delivers 3.9x more than r/ClaudeAI** — viral growth happens outside the AI community, not inside it.
4. **3 YouTube creators match Anthropic's entire channel** — Fireship + CarterPCs + AI Code Arena = 34M views from 23 videos vs Anthropic's 10.1M from 43 videos.
5. **Complaints outperform praise** — negative content (1,462 avg) beats positive (1,342). Frustration drives more sharing than satisfaction.
6. **Comments predict virality, formatting doesn't** — 0.67 correlation for comments vs ~0 for title length, caps, or exclamation marks.
7. **Sunday morning is the sweet spot** — 80% higher engagement than Thursday, yet most content is posted mid-week.
8. **Viral posts flip audience** — daily community targets developers (organic), viral moments reach general public (reactive).

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <repo-url>
cd scrape1
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate      # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
pip install -r lab/requirements.txt

# 2. Set up API keys
cp lab/stage1/processing/.env.example lab/stage1/processing/.env
# Edit .env: set LLM_PROVIDER=ollama (or anthropic/openai/gemini)
# Optional: set YOUTUBE_API_KEY, GROQ_API_KEY, SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL

# 3. If using Ollama (free, local LLM):
ollama pull qwen3:8b

# 4. Run the full machine
cd lab/stage2/part3_automation
python machine.py --ai ollama --reddit-max-items 4000 --youtube-max-items 1500
```

## What This Does

### Part 1: Scrape the Discourse (25% weight)

Three scrapers collecting public conversation about Claude AI:

| Platform | Method | Auth needed | Data collected |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Reddit** | Public JSON API (`reddit.com/r/.../...json`) | None | Posts from r/ClaudeAI + 9 cross-community subreddits |
| **YouTube** | YouTube Data API v3 (free tier) | API key | 60+ search queries with relevance filtering |
| **Twitter/X** | Google Custom Search API | CSE key | `site:twitter.com "Claude AI"` tweet discovery |

Platform prioritization rationale: Reddit has the deepest technical discussion (3K+ posts). YouTube has the widest reach (272M+ total views). Twitter/X was deprioritized because direct API requires paid access ($100/month) and Nitter instances are behind JS challenges. Instagram/LinkedIn/TikTok lack text-heavy AI discourse and require login (violates "public data only" constraint).

### Part 2: Decode the Playbook (30% weight)

A 4-step processing pipeline enriches raw scraper output into analysis-ready data:

```
raw CSV → Step 1: Clean → Step 2: Features → Step 3: NLP → Step 4: LLM → enriched CSV
          dedup, dates    engagement_score    VADER sentiment   content_category
          text normalize  virality flags      TF-IDF keywords   growth_type
          missing values  time features       competitor detect  target_audience
```

Then 16 charts across 3 analysis scripts decode Claude's growth patterns:

| Analysis | Charts | Key questions answered |
|---|---|---|
| **v1: Descriptive** | 7 charts | Volume vs launches, content types, feature mentions, top creators |
| **v2: Sentiment** | 5 charts | Sentiment trends, viral keywords, temporal patterns, engagement correlation |
| **v3: Virality** | 4 charts | What predicts virality, creator tiers, engagement quadrants |

### Part 3: Build the Machine (15% weight)

A fully working automated pipeline that runs the entire intelligence operation:

```bash
# Full cycle: scrape → process → analyze → monitor
python machine.py --ai ollama --reddit-max-items 4000 --youtube-max-items 1500

# Recurring schedule
python machine.py --ai ollama --reddit-max-items 4000 --youtube-max-items 1500 --schedule 6h

# Just check anomalies on existing data
python machine.py --ai ollama --reddit-max-items 0 --youtube-max-items 0 --only-monitor
```

Includes 5 anomaly detection signals (volume spike, sentiment crash, viral breakout, new creator entry, competitor surge) with Slack webhook alerting.

### Part 4: Counter-Playbook (20% weight)

6 concrete growth strategies for a competing AI product, each grounded in our data findings:

1. **Engineer a values moment** — because Pentagon (246K upvotes) beat every product launch
2. **Seed mainstream communities** — because r/technology (3,192 avg) delivers 3.9x more than r/ClaudeAI
3. **Creator partnerships at Mega + Micro tiers** — because 3 creators matched Anthropic's 43-video channel
4. **Optimize for reactive/competitive content** — because reactive (1,681) beats educational (612) by 2.7x
5. **Time launches for weekends** — because Sunday (1,842) beats Thursday (1,023) by 80%
6. **Build dual engines** — technical retention (daily) + narrative acquisition (periodic)

Includes measurement framework, budget allocation, and 6-week execution calendar.

## Assumptions & Tradeoffs

**Platform selection:** Prioritized Reddit (text-heavy discourse), YouTube (widest reach), Twitter/X (real-time sentiment). Skipped Instagram/TikTok (visual-first, minimal AI technical discussion) and LinkedIn (requires login).

**Twitter/X constraint:** The brief requires "public data only, no login-wall scraping." Twitter search requires authentication. We use Google Custom Search API (`site:twitter.com`) as a compliant workaround. Nitter instances were tested but are behind JS challenges that block automated access.

**LLM classification over keyword matching:** Keyword-based classifiers misclassified ~30-40% of posts (51% defaulted to "Discussion"). We moved classification to step4 using LLM providers (Ollama local = $0, Anthropic cloud = ~$0.50/run) for ~95% accuracy. Token consumption tracked in `llm_consumption.csv`. The brief explicitly allows AI assistants.

**Top-post sampling bias:** Reddit's API returns top posts per sort/search combination. For growth analysis this is ideal — we're studying what drives virality, not measuring average post quality. Noted in methodology.

**Recent data oversampling:** Paginating r/ClaudeAI/new gives more 2026 Q1-Q2 posts. Doesn't affect pattern-level findings. Documented in playbook analysis methodology section.

## AI Tools Used

- **Claude Code** (Anthropic) — code generation, architecture design, analysis planning
- **Claude (claude.ai)** — strategy planning, document drafting, data interpretation
- **Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4 API** — batch LLM classification of all 4,346 posts (218 batches, ~530K tokens)
- **Ollama (Qwen 3 8B)** — local LLM for post classification (free alternative to cloud)
- **VADER (nltk)** — rule-based sentiment analysis in step3
- **scikit-learn TF-IDF** — keyword extraction and engagement correlation in step3

All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and validated by running the full pipeline end-to-end. Scraper outputs were spot-checked against live Reddit/YouTube data.

## What We'd Do With More Time

- Add X/Twitter data via a paid scraping API (~$10 for 5K tweets)
- Run Gemini Flash (free tier) as a second classifier and compare accuracy
- Build a Streamlit dashboard for the Monday morning brief
- Add email alerting for HIGH priority signals
- Execute the 6-week counter-playbook calendar with tracking
- A/B test posting times based on the temporal heatmap findings
